General information about NOAA's GitHub Account

Welcome to the official NOAA GitHub Account! NOAA's use of GitHub is intended to share code and content in the spirit of collaboration and open government. Repositories that were not created under the official NOAA account (@NOAAGov) but which are crontributed to by NOAA staff can be found under our "NOAA Affiliated Projects" repository. 

What you will find on this page are many of NOAA's "scientific products", which may include code, data, or documentation of a scientific product according to NOAA's Scientific Integrity Policy. This policy defines such products as "Presentation of the results of scientific activities including the analysis, synthesis, compliation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the Nation.  

All scientific products found through any official NOAA GitHub account are subject to the following disclaimer:

All NOAA GitHub project code is provided on an 'as is' basis and the user assumes responsibility for its use. Any claims against the Department of Commerce or Department of Commerce bureaus stemming from the use of this GitHub project will be governed by all applicable Federal law. Any reference to specific commercial products, processes, or services by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply their endorsement, recommendation or favoring by the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce seal and logo, or the seal and logo of a DOC bureau, shall not be used in any manner to imply endorsement of any commercial product or activity by DOC or the United States Government."
